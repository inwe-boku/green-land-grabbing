## Abstract
Large-scale wind and solar photovoltaic (PV) infrastructures are expanding rapidly in Brazil. These projects can exacerbate struggles for land rooted in weak land governance, with negative impacts for traditional populations due to loss of access to common lands. Here, we trace how green grabbing, i.e. the large-scale appropriation and control of (undesignated) public lands, both formally legal and illicit, for low-carbon technologies, has developed in Brazil throughout 2000 to 2021. We find that global investors and owners, mainly from Europe, are involved in 78% of wind and 96% of solar PV parks, occupying 2,148 km2 and 102 km2 of land, respectively. We also show that land privatization is the prevalent land tenure regime for securing access to and control over land, indicating significant transformations of prior (undesignated) public land. We conclude that green grabbing is a persistent, critical phenomenon in Brazil, requiring transparency and close monitoring of land tenure modifications. 

## Data
Data is either not openly available (this relates to the Bloomberg New Energy Finance dataset), or is openly available, but under a non-permissive license (Brazilian government data and the Global Wind Atlas). We therefore provide the code for the analysis, but cannot provide the underlying data openly.
